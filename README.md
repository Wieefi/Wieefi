# Hi, I'm Efrat Weiss! 

I'm a Computer Science major at Farmingdale State College with a strong passion for technology, creativity, and everything in between. I have experience as a full stack developer and enjoy working on both web and mobile applications. My academic journey has also given me a solid foundation in machine learning, AI concepts, and software engineering principles tools, *which I’m excited to keep building on.*

Outside of coding, I love exploring different software to bring my creative ideas to life. Whether it's designing in Clip Studio Paint, developing in Unity, or modeling in Blender, I’m always looking for new ways to push the boundaries of what I can create.

Once I set my sights on something, I can’t stop until I’ve built something I’m proud of.

*Thanks for stopping by!* ˚ ༘ ೀ⋆｡˚
